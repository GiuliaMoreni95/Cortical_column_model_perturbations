This folder contains all the files with values that the main code needs to be able to run.

To run the cortical column model we need: 
Information to compute number of neuron (perc, perc_tot)
Connections probabilities (connectionsPro)
Connections strenghts (connectionsStren)
External input (I_ext)
Backgroun noise (nu_ext)


Each group of cells has their own parameters:

Resting potential (Vr)
Firing threshold (Vt)
Membrane capacitance (Cm) 
Membrane leak conductance (gL)
Refractory period (tau_ref)
