These are the scripts to generate the figures of the paper. 
Run the desired script to obtain the figure you wish to reproduce. 

All the jupyter notebooks presented here (in the folder 'scripts_figures') will generate the figures of the paper.
The title of each jupyter netebook corresponds to the desired figure. Running them will show and save the desired figure. 
To run the jupyter notebooks codes you only need: 
- python >=3.0
- jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/
- matplotlib>=3.4.3
- seaborn>=0.11.2

Note: The scripts of the figures named "New..." Represent the final figure version used for the revised paper (I apologies the codes are not as cleaned as the previous version, you can find them there as well to have a look at the comments and better understand how they work).

(Note: you do need the folder 'import_files', 'general_files' and 'simulations_data' in your machine. 
KEEP the folder structure intact to be able to run everything without problems)

If you run into problems I will be happy to help you!
