These are the scripts to generate the figures of the paper. 
Run the desired script to obtain the figure you wish to reproduce. 

All the jupyter notebooks presented here (in the folder 'scripts_figures') will generate the figures of the paper.
The title of each jupyter netebook corresponds to the desired figure. Running them will show and save the desired figure. 
To run the jupyter notebooks codes you only need: 
- python >=3.0
- jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/
- matplotlib>=3.4.3
- seaborn>=0.11.2


The script named "New.." is the jupyter notebook used for the revised version of the paper. (I apologies is not cleaned as the previous code version provided for the 1st version of the paper, you can look at that outside this Revision folder). 

(Note: you do need the folder 'import_files', 'general_files' and 'simulations_data' in your machine. 
KEEP the folder structure intact to be able to run everything without problems)

If you run into problems I will be happy to help you!
