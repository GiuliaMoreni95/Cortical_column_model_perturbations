Welcome!

This project folder contains everything you need to reproduce the results in the second version of the paper (after the reviews from Plos Comp Bio):
'Cell type specific firing patterns in a V1 cortical column model depend on feedforward and feedback driven states' Moreni et Al. 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.02.587673v1.full



REPRODUCIBILITY OF FIGURES:
All the jupyter notebooks presented here (in the folder 'scripts_figures') will generate the figures of the paper.
The title of each jupyter notebook corresponds to the desired figure. Running them will show and save the desired figure. 

Note: The scripts of the figures named "New..." Represent the new figure version used for the revised paper (I apologies they are not as cleaned as the previous code version provided for the 1st version of the paper, you can find that outside this folder)

To run the jupyter notebooks codes you only need: 
- python >=3.0
- jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/
- matplotlib>=3.4.3
- seaborn>=0.11.2

FOLDERS ORGANISATION:
The folder 'scripts_figures' contain the jupyter notebooks to reproduce all the figures. 
The folder 'IMAGES' will contain the figures generated by the jupyter notebooks.

The folder 'simulations_data' contains all the data that you need in order to generate the figures. 
These data were obtained by running simulations using the main code.  
The folder 'scripts_simulations' contain the main code used to generate all the results of the simulations. 

The folder 'import_files' contains files that the main code needs to perform the simulations.
The folder 'general_files' contains files that the main code produces to save some relevant info.

The folder 'FINAL_submission' contains all the files that were provided after the revision process to the journal. 


IMPORTANT:
Keep the structure of the folder intact to be able to run the jupyter notebooks and generate all the desired figures. The same is true for the main simulations.
Download the entire folder and then just run the jupyter notebooks/main codes in your machine. 

MAIN CODE:
All the data in 'simulations_data' were generated with the code contained in 'scripts_simulations'.

To run the MAIN CODE Brain2 should be installed. 
See https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/install.html for installations.
Once you have Brian (and python) installed in your machine (and you have downloaded this porject folder) to run the desired simulation just type in your terminal: 
'python MAIN_CODE_iterate.py' 

In order to run the script multiple times with a perturbative input each time going to a different cell group, and also with different perturbative inputs that the reviewer asked etc. 
I used several scripts script_iterations_......sh that call the main code multiple times. 
(This was useful for the perturbation analysis).
I apologies: this are note commented  well but I upload them here anyways in case you want to do extra analysis. They might be useful. 


FINAL REMARKS:
If you run into any problem while reproducing the results you can always contact me at 
g.moreni@uva.nl and I will be happy to help you!

Best,

Giulia Moreni
