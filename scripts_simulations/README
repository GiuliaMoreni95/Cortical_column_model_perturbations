All the data in 'simulations_data' were generated with the code MAIN_CODE_iterate_perturb.py contained in 'scripts_simulations'.

To run the MAIN CODE Brain2 should be installed. 
See https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/install.html for installations.
Once you have Brian (and python) installed in your machine (and you have downloaded this porject folder) to run the desired simulation just type in your terminal: 
'python MAIN_CODE_iterate_perturb.py' 

There are several files MAIN_CODE_iterate_*.py, these are just the ones I used for the different simulations of the paper (keeping FF constant and varying FB and viceversa, etc.), is just a matter of changing the parameters goi are interested in, you can create your own version from the main one "MAIN_CODE_iter_perturb".


In order to run the script multiple times with a perturbative input each time going to a different cell group I used the script script_iterations_perturbation.sh
(This was useful for the perturbation analysis). 
#To run this just type in your terminal:
chmod +x script_iterations_perturbation.sh
And then: 
./script_iterations_perturbation.sh


If you run into any problem while reproducing the results you can always contact me at

Best,
